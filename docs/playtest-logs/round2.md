# Playtest Round 2

## Primary objective
Try out new method of paper prototyping, by placing stones on certain markers. If it works well try to get in a lot of games

## Results

### Data
  * Number of games: 4
  * Player familiarity: none, one played the previous version
  * Time: around 30 minutes
  * Method of playing: placing on markers

### Observations
Game play is much smoother and much more fun for the players. They did not feel game play was a chore, but scoring was a bit awkward. Lowered health down to 30. Most games end up going down to the wire. Not sure if thats a good thing or a bad thing. In case of multiple people losing in the same turn least negative wins. Found only saying your attacks works better than saying all moves during scoring rounds. Rewarding defense made games really slow.

### Feedback
  * Much more fun than previous version
  * Wish something could keep score for me,
  * Desire to reward successful defenses.
