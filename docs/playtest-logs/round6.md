# Playtest Round 6

## Primary objective
Test out varying the cost of attacking and defending in order to allow the players to be rewarded for successful defenses.

## Results
Ended up changing a lot of values resulting in players feeling more rewarded for their plays.Ended up going with:
  * energy points : 60
  * attack cost: 2
  * defense cost: 1
  * damage on successful attack: 5
  * refund on successful defend: 1

### Data
  * Number of games: Around 12 quickfire games and 3 slow games.
  * Player familiarity: decent
  * Time: around 70 minutes
  * Method of playing: video game

### Observations
Players enjoyed being rewarded for defending properly. Also, increasing the effects of landed attacks balanced out the now buffed defending option. The changes make reading players more rewarding and being read more punishing.

### Feedback
  * Resulting feedback summed up in results
