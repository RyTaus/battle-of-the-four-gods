## Playtest Round 1

### Primary objective
To see if the game is fun, and if the gameplay works well. Try a large range of numbers for life and damage to see what feels good.

### Results

#### Data
  * Number of games: 3
  * Player familiarity: none
  * Time: around 30 minutes
  * Method of playing: selecting cutouts

#### Observations
Game play very hindered by method of paper prototyping. Need to find another way to do it. Because of this, got mostly no feedback on the actual gameplay as the method of playing was too rugged.

#### Feedback
  * Could be fun, playing it is a chore though
  * Were unaware crosstalk was encouraged
  * More fun once they knew they could team up
