# Playtest Round 4

## Primary objective
First time playing the online version of the game with playtesters. Hope everything works well, and if so play with a lot of different values.

## Results

### Data
  * Number of games: 6
  * Player familiarity: minimal, some players played previous versions
  * Time: around 40 minutes
  * Method of playing: video games and video games w/ slack

### Observations
Game play is much much smoother. People don't have to worry about anything but strategy and predicting and they said that they could actually think about their moves. People are split on needing more time and waiting for other players to finish. Halfway through started to use slack as a public and private voice chat.

### Feedback
  * Private chat makes the game more fun as it allows access to backstabbing.
  * Automatic math makes gameplay much smoother
  * Is fun trying to figure out what everyone else is doing
  * Fun how games go down to the wire and get really tense.
