## Playtest Round 3 (In Class)

### Primary objective
Show the class the state of the game. Play using 40 Life, 3 damage, no reward on defending.

### Results

#### Data
  * Number of games: 1
  * Player familiarity: none
  * Time: around 10 minutes
  * Method of playing: placing on markers

#### Observations
Definitely need to digitize the scoring system. Lack of private chat hurts the ability to team up. Also there is a difference in how people play when they all know each other and not.

#### Feedback
  * Would be easy to digitize
  * Feels like there is no strategy
  * Random is just as good as having a plan.
