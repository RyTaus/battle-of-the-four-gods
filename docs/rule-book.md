# Rule Book
## Summary
Battle of the Four Gods is played in a series of rounds where players expend ENERGY POINTS in order to either attack or defend from other players. When a player reaches 0 ENERGY POINTS they are eliminated. The last player standing wins.

## Components
To play Battle of the Four Gods you will need:
* A game board consisting of:
  * 4 player dividers
  * 12 ATTACK indicators (3 of each color)
  * 12 DEFENSE indicators (3 of each color)
  * 4 ENERGY POINTS counters
  * 1 Timer (30 seconds)
* A method for players to communicate in secret.

## Game Setup
1. Place the player dividers so that no player can see behind any other players divider.
2. Each player takes an ENERGY POINTS counter and places it in a location such that every player can see it and set it to 100.
3. Place the timer in a location such that every player can see it.
4. Lastly, each player takes 1 ATTACK and 1 DEFENSE indicator for each color other than their own.

## The Game

### The Round

A round consists of 2 distinct phases.
* The Planning Phase: The timer starts. Each player concurrently selects up to 3 ACTIONS to take for this round.
* The Results Phase: Each player reduces their ENERGY POINTS as according to the ACTIONS section.

After the results phase the game proceeds to the next round and starts with a new planning phase.

During all points of the game, except directly after the planning phase while results are being calculated, table talk is encouraged. Table talk refers not only to public speech, but also private messages to any of the players.

#### Planning Phase
Each player selects anywhere from 0 to 3 ACTIONS to perform. Each action costs 1 ENERGY POINT. To select an action place the desired indicator behind your divider on the section marked for active actions. When the timer expires lift your divider so that everyone can see what actions you chose. Then, enter the results phase.

Notes:
* A player cannot choose more actions than they have remaining ENERGY POINTS. If a player has 2 ENERGY POINTS they can only select 2 actions.
* There is no rule forcing your chosen ACTIONS to be private, if a player would like, they can reveal their actions prematurely, However, if a player lifts their divider and exposes their actions they cannot change them. This does not apply if a player merely says their intended action.

#### Results Phase
The results phase processes the results of all the players selected actions.
1. Each player decreases their current ENERGY POINTS by 1 for every action chosen.

  * If a player is found guilty of not decreasing their ENERGY POINTS correctly then they adjust their score to what it should have become and decrease their ENERGY POINTS by an additional 10.

2. Starting from the red player and going clockwise each player declares the colors they chose an ATTACK ACTION AGAINST. This can go two ways.

  * The attacked player defended against the attacking players color. No ENERGY POINT deduction.
  * The attacked player did not defend against the attacking players color. The defending player loses 3 energy points.

  If a player is reduced to 0 or fewer ENERGY POINTS then their actions for that turn still go through. The ordering of this phase is simply to ease the process. The attacks are all happening simultaneously.

  * As a result of this, if you find you and your fellow players operate the game more smoothly with a different ordering of this step then feel free to do so.

3. If a player is reduced to 0 or fewer ENERGY POINTS then they are eliminated from the game. In future rounds actions involving the color of an eliminated player cannot be chosen.
  * If they are chosen in error then they are voided and considered a non-action.
  If all remaining players are eliminated in the same round the winner is the player with the largest amount of ENERGY POINTS.

## Winning the Game
A player wins the game if at the end of a round every other player is eliminated.

In the case that at the end of a round every player has been eliminated, then the winner is the player with the largest amount of ENERGY POINTS that was eliminated during that round. If multiple players eliminated that round have the same amount of energy points then the game is a tie between those players.

## Terms

### Actions
Each player has access to 6 actions.
  * 3 ATTACK actions (1 for each opponent color) (Indicates the target)
  * 3 DEFENSE actions (1 for each opponent color) (Indicates the opponent defending from)

Each action has a uniform cost of 1 ENERGY POINT.

### Energy Points
Each player begins the game with 100 energy points. These serve as your life force during the game. Performing actions and receiving undefended attacks drain your energy points. When a player reaches 0 energy points they are eliminated.
